# LEOimgsat

This program simulates Earth surface optical image capture quality from Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) based on user's input of camera specifications (spatial resolution, lens' point spread function, FOV). Treating ESA's Sentinel satellite images as the base "perfect" image, the program applies the appropriate averaging and gaussian blur filters to produce an image with a quality to be expected fromm the user's chosen camera specifications.

The main motivation for this program is to help in choosing off-the-shelf camera solutions for low-budget optical image capture CubeSat missions.
